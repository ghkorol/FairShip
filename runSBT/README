How to run SBT hit rate analysis on lxplus:

1. Install FairShip software following instructions in 
	https://github.com/ghkorol/FairShip/blob/master/README.md

2. cd FairShip/runSBT

3. ./compile.sh  #it will compile getEntries.C script for getting number of events from root files
 
4. ./getEntriesForAllFiles.sh #this script provide getEntriesForAllFiles.out with the list of all root files 
                              #in your dataset with their number of events
    #To define data set check line 4, and define your files in for loop
	/eos/experiment/ship/data/Mbias/background-prod-2018/pythia8_Geant4_10.0_withCharmandBeauty{0..66000..1000}_mu.root

5. ./createRunSimList.sh > queue_list.txt #create queue list for simulation step,
                                          #which will be used by condor submit script
    #To define number of events per run change 'eventsPerRunMax' variable

6. condor_submit sim.sub # Start simulation
   
   # Impotrant. 
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in sim.sub are existing. 
     2.Check that OUTPUTDIR path in sim.sh is correct

7. ./createRunRecoList.sh > queue_list_reco.txt #create queue	list for simulation step, 
                                                #which will be used by condor submit script

    # Impotrant.
     1.Check 'inPath', it should point to directory with files created at simulations step

8. condor_submit reco.sub # Start reconstruction step

   # Impotrant.
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in reco.sub are existing.
     2.Check that 'OUTPUTDIR' and 'INPUTDIR' pathes in reco.sh are correct

9. ./createRunAnaList.sh > queue_list_ana.txt #create queue   list for analysis step,
                                                #which will be used by condor submit script

    # Impotrant.
     1.Check 'inPath', it should point to directory with files created at reconstruction step

10. condor_submit ana.sub # Start analysis step

   # Impotrant.
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in ana.sub are existing.
     2.Check that 'OUTPUTDIR' and 'INPUTDIR' pathes in ana.sh are correct
     3.Be schuare you call correct VetoAna2.py script in ana.sh

11. Go to directory with output files after analysis step, and run hadd.sh script there.
    As output data.root will be created.


12. To produce plots of SBT Digi Hit Rates the following root macros are used runall.C, runallW.C, plotDigiHist.C, plotDigiHistW.C 
    run macro:
     'root -l runall.C' or 'root -l runallW.C'
    
    To define which data.root file has to be used one has to edit plotDigiHist.C or plotDigiHistW.C file.
